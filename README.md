# XBRL API

[browse documentation on web front end](https://xbrlus.github.io/xbrl-api)

The XBRL API is connected to the XBRL US Public Filings Database - updated approximately every 15 minutes from the SEC's EDGAR system.  Any database with XBRL data can use the XBRL API to retrieve data from it.

The APIs documented here (using our database) require a valid XBRL US API key which is freely available at <a href="http://xbrl.us/apirequest" target="_blank">http://xbrl.us/apirequest</a>.
