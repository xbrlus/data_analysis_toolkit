This could return multiple results as Assets for example could be in multiple locations in a filing. The user passes an element and filing number/CIK and the report url will be returned. The API allows the user to specify the different linkbases associated with a report.  For example  a user can request the calculation network for those reports that contain Assets for company ABC.

If an element name is included then all the networks in the filing are returned.  This is a good way to identify all the networks in a given filing.

### **Sample URL**
 In the sample URL below, replace text "EnterKeyHere" (without quotes) with your API key to return data in your browser window: 

  <http://csuite.xbrl.us/php/dispatch.php?Task=xbrlNetwork&Element=Assets&AccessionID=143908s&API_Key=EnterKeyHere>

### **Method**

  The API supports the following

  `GET` | `POST`

### **URL Params**

   **Required:**

  `TASK=xbrlNetwork`

  `API_Key=[uuid]` - A valid API Key must be provided. This is freely available from XBRL US at <http://xbrl.us/apirequest>

  `AccessionID=[int] OR Accession=[alpha]`
   - AccessionID: Internal Accession identifier used by the XBRL US database. This is a unique filing identifier. For example one company will have many filings. This is returned by the API and can be used in subsequent calls. This allows a comma separated list.

   - Accession: SEC Filing accession number. This is the accession number used as the filing identifier used by the SEC. This parameter does not allow a comma separated list.

 `GroupURI=[uri]`  - The extended link role in an XBRL report that is defined by the company. For example: http://www.babc.com/taxonomy/role/StatementOfFinancialPosition

   **Optional:**

  `Element=[alphanumeric]` - The element name in the base taxonomy. This parameter will **not** take a comma separated list.

  `Linkbase=[Calculation|Definition|Presentation]` - The type of network relationship. This could be a Presentation, Calculation or Definition. If this is not entered then the presentation links will be returned.


  `CIK=[integer]`   - CIK of the Company. This must be 10 digits in length. This parameter allows a comma separated list.

   **Minimum:**

   All calls to the API must include the `Element` parameter name and at least an `AccessionID` or an `Accession` number or a `CIK` parameter.


### **Data Params**

  The API supports the same params as the URL.

### **Success Response (Normal)**

    <dataRequest date="2015-10-06T19:34:20-0400">

        <entity>
          <![CDATA[ APPLE INC ]]>
        </entity>
        <entityCode>0000320193</entityCode>

      </fact>
      <count>1</count>
    </dataRequest>
```

  `dataRequest - date` - The data request date attribute is the date that the data was generated. It is not the date of the query.  Data is cached once it is requested and is returned from cache if available. The data remains in cache for a day from the request. This means that data could be up to a day old if it has been previously requested.


### **Error Response**
