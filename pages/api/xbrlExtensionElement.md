The API allows the user to get the attributes of an extension element and the associated labels.  If the filing information is provided the API will return the labels used by the company in their extension filing.  As a convenience it will also return the attributes of the US GAAP taxonomy.  

### **Sample URL**
 In the sample URL below, replace text "EnterKeyHere" (without quotes) with your API key to return data in your browser window: 

  <http://csuite.xbrl.us/php/dispatch.php?Task=xbrlExtensionElement&Element=ResearchDevelopmentAndRelatedExpenses&API_Key=EnterKeyHere>

### **Method**

  The API supports the following

  `GET` | `POST`

### **URL Params**

   **Required:**

  `TASK=xbrlExtensionElement`

  `API_Key=[uuid]` - A valid API Key must be provided. This is freely available from XBRL US at <http://xbrl.us/apirequest>

   **Optional:**

  `Element=[alphanumeric]` - The element name in the base taxonomy. This parameter will **not** take a comma separated list.

  `Namespace=[url]` - The namespace of the company filing the data is requested for. For example http://www.ovt.com/20150430.

  `AccessionID=[int]` - Internal Accession identifier used by the XBRL US database. This is a unique filing identifier. For example one company will have many filings. This is returned by the API and can be used in subsequent calls. This allows a comma separated list.

  `dataRequest - date` - The data request date attribute is the date that the data was generated. It is not the date of the query.  Data is cached once it is requested and is returned from cache if available. The data remains in cache for a day from the request. This means that data could be up to a day old if it has been previously requested.
